Creating a new footprint:

1. Draw boundary on F.CrtYd (graphic line)
2. Add pads using "Add pad" in the right toolbar.
For more options use their properties page (double click on any pad).
Pos X/Y refers to this pad's center position.

For SMD (and other) pads place a THT connector and change it's settings.

Useful:

 - Select a grid from the dropdown in the top toolbar
 - Offset the grid for fast pad placement:

 - personal preference: boundary aligns with the part, no extra spacing inside the boundary
